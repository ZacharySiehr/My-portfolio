      <p><strong>Title:</strong> <em>Novel Green Synthesis of Noble Metal Nanoparticles</em></p>
      <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The biomedical properties of nanoparticles have been vastly studied. However, issues with long-term toxicity to people and the environment have remained due to the use of harsh reducing agents and solvents used in synthesizing the nanoparticles. Because of this, the need for a process that utilizes safe and eco-friendly solvents and precursors exists. 
The goal of this research is to develop and design a novel method for the synthesis of amino-stabilized silica and silver nanoclusters. This process is aimed to reduce the impact on Humans and the environment, following several principles of “Green Chemistry” by eliminating the use of harsh reducing and capping agents, requiring only two precursors in polar solvents, and reducing unwanted waste products. Amino acids in the presence of polar solvents have been seen to act as biogenic stabilizing and capping agents in synthesizing metal nanoparticles. Specifically, Sulfur (thiol), containing amino acids, in the presence of heat, can act as a reducing agent and stabilize the nanoparticles through a repulsive force that protects against aggregation and controls velocity, geometric shape, and final size of the nanoparticle. 
The dimensions of the silica and silver nanoparticles are in the range of 5-10 nm. The synthesized nanoparticles will be characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-Visible absorption spectroscopy (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM & EDX), dynamic light scattering, and room-temperature photoluminescence.

      <p><strong>Summary:</strong> A broad spectroscopic investigation to better understand the structure and interactions between polyethylene oxide (PEO) and fullerenes (C60) is reported. PEO-C60 nanocomposites (PEO-C60NC) were obtained by dissolving PEO and C60 in water, mixing, and homogenization these dispersions by stirring, and water evaporation. This path exploited the insolubility of C60 in water, thus resulting in a standard polymer nanocomposite. The molecular dispersion of C60 in PEO (PEO-C60MD) was obtained by dissolving PEO and C60 in a common solvent (toluene, chloroform), mixing the two solutions, and evaporating the solvent. The outcome was a polymer within which C60 is molecularly dispersed, (PEO-C60MD). PEO-C60NC and PEO-C60MD containing various weight fractions of C60 were prepared.

Spectroscopic studies by X-ray diffraction (using a Bruker Discovery 8 spectrometer), Raman spectroscopy (using a Renishaw InVia Raman confocal microscope operating at 785 nm), FTIR (using a Bruker Tensor 27 coupled with a Hyperion FTIR confocal microscope), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and Electron Spin Resonance (using an EPR Elexsys spectrometer operating in the X-band) have been carried out on both PEO-C60MD and PEO-C60NC.

The modifications of the structural properties of PEO upon the addition of C60, either as a nanofiller or as a molecularly dispersed component, are investigated and reported in detail, with emphasis on the differences between the nanocomposite and the molecularly dispersed sample.
